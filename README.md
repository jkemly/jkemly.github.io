## About Me
Hello! Welcome to my personal website. My name is Jason Kemly. I am currently a 4th year student at Northeastern University. I study Computer Science, and I am expected to get my Bachelor of Science degree when I graduate in May 2021. Please pardon the look of my personal website - I didn't quite have time to spruce it up with HTML and CSS yet, but I will certainly get the ball rolling on that soon enough. From there, I will be able to display some of my HTML and CSS Development skills.

# Personal Projects
I've had several ongoing personal projects over the past few years. The one I am most proud of is my Catan Random Board Generator. This project is an iOS application that can generate random Catan boards based on several customization settings specified by the user. The app has a sleek UI and a pleasant color scheme. It has proven to be very helpful to me and my family whenever we play Catan, since we can get a better sense of how the board turns out before we play the game.

# Professional Experience
I've held several professional positions over the past few years as an intern and as a co-op student. I've worked at Bloomberg as a Software Engineering Intern, and I've also held a co-op at Wolters Kluwer as a Software/DevOps Engineer.

# Personal Interests
Some of my interests include running, playing the guitar, doing community service, playing board games, completing Sudoku puzzles, and going ice skating.
